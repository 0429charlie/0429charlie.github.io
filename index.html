				<h2 id="nmylife">My Life</h2>
				<p>
				This section is about my wonderful life experience. Being well educated, my parents always encourage me to learn new talents
				and are not afraid to invest on me for learning new skills. As a result, I experienced learning several instruments, boardgames, sports, 
				and languages. My parents also believe traveling can make a person smarter and allow one to think outside of the box. Therefore, 
				they always schedule a vacation in a foreign country at least once a year. Thus, I traveled to many countries since I was very young. 
				Each of my unique experience in different countries is detailedly described in "my life" page. Please click the link below to view

				<h2 id="neducation">Education</h2>
				<p>
				This section is about my education. Having the chance living in different countries, I experienced learning in different schools from 
				countries that I had lived. Born in Taiwan, I had my preschool there. My mother heard that education in Singapore is much better, so 
				she brought me to Singapore when I was second year in my preschool. However, I was brought back to Taiwan for my third year in 
				pre-school. After I graduated from preschool, I was lucky enough to move to Japan and start my elementary school there. Within 8 
				months or so, I had to move to China with my family due to my father's job relocation. Thus, I had my grade 2 and 3 in China. At the 
				end of grade 3, I moved back to Japan again and I finished my elementary school there. After my graduation, I went back to Taiwan, my 
				home country, for vacation and then moved to Vancouver in Canada. Interestingly, Canada have 7 years of elementary school. Thus, I had 
				my second elementary school graduation there. My high school life was also in Vancouver. It was pretty fun until I graduated in 2014. 
				In my grade 12 year, I was successfully accepted into University of Waterloo and I moved to Waterloo, Ontario, in 2014 where I started 
				learning programming. Please click the link for the detail of each school and the education I had

				<h2 id="ninternship&project">Internship(Coop) and Project</h2>
				<p>
				This section is about the internship(Coop) I had and the project I contributed to. Thanks to the University of Waterloo Co-op program, I 
				am able to apply what I learned in school in real life tasks. It also gives me opportunity to contribute to some great project on-going in 
				some well-known companies. For each internship, I will explain what I learned and how I used the knowledge learned in school. It some times 
				include the challenging project that I worked on. In addition, there are assignments from school that is also a big project. Please click 
				the link for more about my internships and projects

				<h2 id="nhobby&interest">Hobby and Interest</h2>
				<p>
				My father always mention that interest is motivation and thus it is important to have a job that I like not what I don't like. My 
				mother agree with it and she always encourage me to try new things to discover my interest. After trying many activities, I am able to 
				know more about myself. To be specific, I become to know that I am not bad or good at drawing, which I thought I was very good at when 
				I was 15 years old. I become to know that I like to play sport as a team and I am a very good team leader. I become to know that I actually 
				like to take the roles with great responsibility such as club president. Most importantly, I become to know that I like to code. Please click 
				the link for more interesting fact about me that I discover by trying new things, which become my hobby and interest
