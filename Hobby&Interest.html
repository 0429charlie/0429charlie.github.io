				<h2 id="nhobby&interest">Hobby and Interest</h2>
				<p>
				I am lucky to be able to try many activities to find my hobby and interests with the supports from parents. Some of them even 
				changed my life and my way of thinking. The followings are some of my hobby and interests that have some impact on my life and 
				my personalities
				</p>
				<h2 id="ngo">Go</h2>
				<p>
				Go is a traditional Chinese broad game that train one's logical thinking. It is not widely know in western countries until Google 
				came up with Alpha Go, an artificial intelligent that defeat the Go world champion. It is one of the hardest game in the world with 
				endless possible moves. I first encounter the game in China. I very enjoy the game that I decide to keep playing it. Even now, I still 
				play the game online whenever I have time. Go is not only a game that people can play but also a career that people can pursuit. I once 
				think about become a professional Go player but I changed my mind later. However, I did took a certificate that show my rank in the Go 
				society. Go player is rank from 20k all the way down to 1k following by 1d to 10d. People can get certificate of each level from the 
				<a href="http://www.nihonkiin.or.jp/" style="float:none; padding:0;">Go society</a>. I successfully get my 1D certificate in Japan when I 
				was grade six, which allow me to be a certified Go teacher. Later on in Canada, I also took second and third place in Go tournament which 
				was hold in Vancouver
				</p>
				<h2 id="nsoccer">Soccer</h2>
				<p>
				Although I am generally good at sport, I play soccer exceptional well. Since grade four, I was always part of the soccer team until I entered 
				university and started to concentrate on my academic and coding. I first got in a soccer team in Japan, both in school and outside the school. 
				Since I ran quite fast, my friends invited me to the soccer team thinking I would be a great player. It turned out that I was not only a great 
				player but also an interesting player who run very fast and are good at passing and shooting ball using left foot. However, I was never a good 
				player by myself. My playing style heavily relied on my teammates. I was very good at team work instead of individual skills. Although I was 
				not good at one on one, I believe having a great teamwork is much stronger than having a great player. In fact, one thing that I enjoyed the most 
				playing soccer is winning as a team
				</p>
				<h2 id="npiano">Piano</h2>
				<p>
				Within many instruments I learned, piano is the one I started earliest. My parents planned to let me learned many instruments so they encouraged 
				me to start from piano since it is the basic. They were right. After piano, I started to learn many different instruments. While learning other 
				instruments, I took a break from piano. However, I always come back to play piano whenever I quit playing an instrument. Thus, I never 
				quit piano but just taking break in between. Eventually, I reach to the level to challenge the RCM grade 8 piano exam. Spending long time playing 
				piano, I was able to pass the exam easily. I passed the practical exam with reasonably good mark and I pass the theory exam with a great mark!
