				<h2 id="ninternship&project">Internship(Coop) and Projects</h2>
				<p>
				Thanks to University of Waterloo co-op program, I am able to gain some hands on experience by having some internships. These internships 
				allows me to participate in some real-life ongoing projects and make some contributions to the companies. The followings are the description 
				of the internships and the project that I participated or leaded (*please click the company names to go to their website)

					<h4>Online register and order form</h4>
					<p>
					These forms are built by me without any help from my coworker. They allow the customers to register their information and order products online. 
					It is consisted if HTML, CSS, and PHP. Please do not fill out the forms and submit them since they might lead to sending a request of buying the 
					products if the website is still being used

					<h4>Auto Marking App (online & Desktop)</h4>
					<p>
					I build the prototype of the app which allows student to do quizzes online. The online app will then auto mark the multiple choice questions and 
					send the questions and answers to teacher to mark the written questions. Teachers can also login to the web page to mark the questions online. This 
					app is consisted of HTML, CSS, and PHP. The desktop version, on the other hand, is consisted of C++. It is a Console app that reads students answer 
					and produce the mark written in separate text file. This prototype later on is used in a presentation and help the company to gained a contract from 
					a university.

					<h4>API Unit Testing</h4>
					<p>
					As a tester, my primary gaol in this coop term is to maintain the already existing unit tests and create new tests for the new features of the 
					products. These are done by C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. In addition, the company decide to make up some API testing using Postman and 
					Visual Studio. They brought in two co-op students to start the project and I was one of them. The test was about sending JSON through web API and get 
					back a JSON to see of the functionalities if the web products is working or not. As a result, we had to consist the JSON using C# and sent it 
					through the web API then verified the returned JSON is the expected one. These all have to be automated as unit tests. The project was a success and 
					nearly 200 tests were created for the first try and they ran very fast.

					<h4>DataBridge and Traffic Log</h4>
					<p>
					DataBridge is a data access infrastructure used in RBC GAM. It provides multiple ways of retrieving data from RBC GAM database. For example, data 
					can be retrieved from Microsoft Excel by installing the adds-in to Excel. One of my job was to enhance the web user interface that is used to 
					retrieve data. The web interface was built with cshtml, css boostrap, javascript for the frontend (in MVC5 framework) and C# (in Entity Framework) 
					for the backend. I followed MVC5 framework in adding buttons and input fields onto the web interface and link them to the code that I implemented 
					in C# as part of the Entity Framework. Other than retrieving data, DataBridge should also log the data request that occur from various users from 
					various places. My another contribution to DataBridge is to create the logging functionality and a user interface to view the log on the DataBridge 
					website. This required me to create algorithm that log all the data to database using Entity Framework whenever 'GetData' is called and a corresponding 
					dynamic user interface that shows the content of the database on the website. In addition, I implemented a searching algorithm that allows user to search 
					the log on the interface using wild cards such as * which match one or more character in the record.
					</p>

					<h4>R Interop</h4>
					<p>
					Building R interop was another big challenge that I faced in this work term. The idea is to enable programmers using other languages to use the DataBridge's 
					functionalities in their languages. In other words, we want to build an interop (bridging component) between the two languages. Since DataBridge is a data 
					access infrastructure, it is ideal to have R and Python user be able to use DataBridge for data analysis. One of my co-worker was running a Python Interop 
					project and I was assigned to complete the R Interop project on my own. I started project by doing the research. My co-worker recommended me to look into the 
					way to import common language runtime (CLR) into R to start since DataBridge is in .Net framework. I discovered an R package called rClr that enable users to 
					Call .Net code (functions) using R syntax. It also import the common language runtime at the same time! However, I soon realized I can not just use rClr but I 
					have to created a wrapper of rClr that is for accessing DataBridge specifically for better user experience. The wrapper make the user to access the data by only 
					providing some of the inputs that is obviously needed. All the other setup and declaration was handled by the wrapper including the import of common language 
					run time, which is done when the user reference the R package that I created (the wrapper). In addition, I also build a C# console app that will prepare the file 
					system and automatically installed into the local R environment when launched.

						<h4>Outbound Sales Assistance</h4>
						<p>
						Having a 4 months break at the end of my first year university, I decide to go back to my home for family union. My father, who just quite his job and finally 
						settle down in Vancouver, was not able to keep his boring retired life. He decided to go find a job. He eventually became a sales man for the Internet. I, 
						on the other hand, was boring too for the long break. Thus, my father asked me if I want to try his job. Luckily, my father knew people who were willing to 
						hire me for only couple months as sales assistance. I was responsible for out reaching to potential clients, fill out the form and submit the request on behave 
						of client to the Telus website, and provides resources to client when they have any problem using the product.

						<h4>CS349 User Interface</h4>
						<p>Assignment 1 - Side-scrolling Game</p>
						<p>
						This assignment was one of the most interesting assignment I had done in University of Waterloo. It was about building up a side-scrolling 
						game using Java and MVC framework. The code was all about Java and Java SWING, which provide JFrame, JPanel, and many other components that 
						allows people to create user interface with pure Java code only. The source code was then build with Ant that enable player to run the application 
						from command line using ant command. The project is on uWaterloo git hub and is not public. However, I have the source code and am able to show 
						and explain them in person.
						</p>
						<p>Assignment 2 - Star Animation</p>
						<p>
						This assignment served the purpose of creating non-legging animation that respond to user input. It was also built by Java and Java SWING completely. 
						It allowed students to understand how event queue work and how to print the image timely to create non-legging animation.
						</p>
						<a href="CS349_S17/A3/index.html" style="float:none; padding:0;"><p>Assignment 3 - UWaterloo API</p></a>
						<p>
						The assignment 3 of CS349 course was very different with the previous two. It concentrated on exploring web components such as HTML, CSS, and AJAX API.
						The end product was a user friendly dynamic web page that retrieve data from University of Waterloo Open Data API. Please click on "Assignment 3 - UWaterloo 
						API" to see the website.

						<h4>CS350 Operating System</h4>
						<p>
						All of the assignment from CS350 was about building part of the os161. We were given an incomplete os161 at the beginning at the term and ended up in 
						a complete os161 at the end. The assignment include implementing locks and condition variables for multi-threading. In addition, using the implemented 
						locks and condition variables to implement system call such as getpid and fork. In order to implement these functionalities, we faced the challenges such 
						as mapping virtual memory to physical memory and running code in kernel mode securely. The completed os161 is on uwaterloo github and University of Waterloo 
						student environment. I am not able to distribute the code but am able to show them in person.
