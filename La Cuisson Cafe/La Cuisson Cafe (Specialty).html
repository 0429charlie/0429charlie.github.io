					<h3>The coffee beans we use-Siphon</h3>
					<p>Syphon style coffee is one of the few methods that allows the distinctive characteristics of each type of coffee bean to be expressed completely. For a barista to make the perfect cup of coffee, he has to extract only the enjoyable tastes and aroma from the coffee powder, while leaving bitterness out of the cup. To do this , there are many factors that he has to keep track of; the water temperature, the weight of the stirring, and the duration of the entire brewing process.</p>

					<h3>High coffee</h3>
					<p>High Tea is very common in a tea shop, but have you ever see High Coffee? One of our special products, that I think you only can find it here, is High Coffee. Since tea is a perfect drink while eating cake, coffee is also great. Come to La Cuisson to have a cup of coffee and some cakes to relax and enjoying the afternoon.</p>
